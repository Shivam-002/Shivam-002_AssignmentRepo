■ Lottery Smart Contract

□ Overview

This is a simple Ethereum lottery smart contract written in Solidity. The contract allows users to enter a lottery by sending a minimum amount of Ether, with the contract manager being able to pick a random winner who will receive the entire balance of the contract.

□ Features

Manager Role: The address that deploys the contract is designated as the manager and has exclusive rights to pick the winner.

Player Entry: Users can participate in the lottery by sending at least 1 Ether to the contract.

Winner Selection: The contract uses a pseudo-random number generator to select a winner from the pool of participants.

Resetting Players: After picking a winner, the list of players is cleared for a new lottery round. Check Players: Users can view the list of participants in the lottery. Requirements

Solidity version: >=0.7.0 <0.9.0 Ethereum client or testnet for deployment and interaction. Contract Details

□ Variables

address public manager: Stores the address of the manager (deployer). address payable[] public players: Array of addresses representing the players who have entered the lottery. Functions
□ Constructor

constructor(): Initializes the contract with the deployer's address as the manager. Entry Function

function enter() payable public: Allows users to enter the lottery. Requires: Sender is not the manager. Sender has not already entered. A minimum amount of 1 Ether is sent. Winner Selection

function pickWinner() public: Picks a random winner and transfers the contract balance to them. Only callable by the manager. Utility Functions

function alreadyEntered() view private returns(bool): Checks if the caller has already entered the lottery.

function random() view private returns(uint): Generates a pseudo-random number based on block data and player addresses.

function getPlayers() view public returns(address payable[] memory): Returns the current list of players. Deployment and Usage

• Deploy the Contract: Deploy the Lottery contract using an Ethereum development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat).

Enter the Lottery: Send at least 1 Ether to the contract address using the enter function.

Pick a Winner: The manager can call pickWinner to select a random winner and transfer the prize.

View Participants: Call getPlayers to view the list of participants. Security Considerations

The pseudo-random number generator is not truly random and may not be secure for high-stakes lotteries. For better randomness, consider integrating a secure randomness source like Chainlink VRF. Ensure to handle gas costs and transaction limits appropriately to avoid failures during execution. License
