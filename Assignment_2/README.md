# Smart Contract Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various common smart contract problems. Each solution is implemented in a separate file named `q1`, `q2`, etc.

## Solutions

### 1. Hello World Contract

**Question:** How can a smart contract return a simple message, like "Hello, World!"?

**Solution:** The contract in `q1` returns the message "Hello, World!" when called.

### 2. Simple Storage

**Question:** How can a smart contract store and retrieve a single integer value?

**Solution:** The contract in `q2` allows storing and retrieving a single integer value.

### 3. Greeting Contract

**Question:** How can a smart contract allow a user to set and get a personalized greeting message?

**Solution:** The contract in `q3` allows users to set and get a personalized greeting message.

### 4. Simple Counter

**Question:** How can a smart contract keep track of a count and allow it to be incremented?

**Solution:** The contract in `q4` keeps track of a count and allows it to be incremented.

### 5. Name Storage

**Question:** How can a smart contract store and retrieve a user's name?

**Solution:** The contract in `q5` allows storing and retrieving a user's name.

### 6. Basic Voting

**Question:** How can a smart contract allow users to vote for a candidate and keep track of votes?

**Solution:** The contract in `q6` allows users to vote for a candidate and keeps track of votes.

### 7. Owner Access

**Question:** How can a smart contract restrict certain functions to only the contract owner?

**Solution:** The contract in `q7` restricts certain functions to only the contract owner.

### 8. Event Logging

**Question:** How can a smart contract log events when certain actions are performed?

**Solution:** The contract in `q8` logs events when certain actions are performed.

### 9. Simple Ledger

**Question:** How can a smart contract maintain a ledger of transactions with basic entries?

**Solution:** The contract in `q9` maintains a ledger of transactions with basic entries.

### 10. Message Storage

**Question:** How can a smart contract allow a user to store and retrieve a message string?

**Solution:** The contract in `q10` allows a user to store and retrieve a message string.

## Running the Contracts

To run any of these contracts, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the contract using your preferred Ethereum development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle).
2. Interact with the contract using the provided functions to test the implemented features.

Each contract file (`q1`, `q2`, etc.) contains the necessary code to perform the described operations. Make sure to review and understand the code before deploying it to a live environment.
